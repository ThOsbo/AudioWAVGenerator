# AudioWAVGenerator
A set of python code designed to synthesise instruments and then create audio .wav files

## Synthesis
- Generates sin, square, sawtooth (ramp) and triangle waves as well as noise
- Contains a low pass high pass and notch filter for filtering frequencies from waves
- Amplitude envolpe modulator with attack, decay and release times and sustain level

## Music
- Currently contains a synthesis violin (as close as I could get)
- Strings notes together lasting different beat lengths to make a musical piece
- Can add multiple instruments to play in tandem
